**REACT**
Birth of Single Page Application (clicking on the new links won't create a new request to a server). It loads only a single web document, and then updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript APIs such as XMLHttpRequest and Fetch when different content is to be shown.
React is like - don't touch the DOM, I will do it. 
Build websites like lego blocks.
One way data flow- data can move only from the state down. It makes debugging much easier.
- Organising better code

Declarative style- 
based on the state of the app react to it. 

What does react do? It translates the code we have in src into public folder (that's what our browsers understand). Will create build folder which is optimised (will use babel and webpack). Babel will make sure our js will be understood by different browsers. Webpack 

By using class component we will have an access to something called STATE that we don't have an access to in funcitonal componenets
