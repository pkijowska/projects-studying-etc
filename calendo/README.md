# Inspired by:
Saw this challenge somewhere on github... https://github.com/Jobsity/ReactChallenge
As a todo list is a common interview task I decided to take it to another level and create a calendar where you can add a new event and see the monthly snapshot of a todo list.


#### Plan

- [ ] Add calendar view
- [ ] Ability to add daily reminders / delete them
- [ ] Edit daily reminders / 2nd phase
- [ ] Clicking on a arrow shows the view for previous/next month / 2nd phase
- [ ] Unit test
- /calendar will show the main calendar view
- [ ] Add redux
- [ ] Ability to add a location to the day
- [ ] Make it mobile responsive
- [ ] Work on accesibility

## Run
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
