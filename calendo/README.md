# Inspired by:
Saw this challenge somewhere on github... https://github.com/Jobsity/ReactChallenge
As a todo list is a common interview task I decided to take it to another level and create a calendar where you can add a new event and see the monthly snapshot of a todo list.


#### Plan

- [x] Add calendar view
- [x] Ability to add daily reminders / delete them
- [ ] Clicking on a arrow shows the view for previous/next month -> 2nd phase
- [x] Jest tests
- [x] /calendar will show the main calendar view
- [x] Add state management redux
- [ ] Ability to add a location to the day -2nd phase
- [ ] Make it mobile responsive -2nd phase
- [ ] Work on accesibility -2nd phase

#### Current look
